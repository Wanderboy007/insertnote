          Skin is the outermost covering and the largest organ of the
          integumentary system of our body. It protects deeper tissue from harsh
          environment, regulate temperature, and prevents loss of water; the
          sensory receptors attached to it are involved in detecting pain,
          pressure and temperature. other functions are insulation, vitamin D
          synthesis and immunity to protect against pathogen invaders, hence
          skin function as overall protection barrier but burns destroy the
          protection barrier but burns destroy the protection shield, and our

          A burn occurs when heat, chemicals, sunlight, electricity or radiation
          damages skin tissue. Most burns happen accidentally. There are
          different degrees of burns. Your healthcare provider determines the
          seriousness (degree) of a burn based on the depth of the burn and the
          amount of affected skin. Burns can be painful. Left untreated, a burn
          can lead to infection.

          Burn is associated with severe skin damage. therefore, serious burns
          injury needs immediate medical support to prevent further complication
          and death. Burns occurs when energy from a heat source is transferred
          to the tissues of the body. Heat may be transferred through conduction
          or electromagnetic radiation.

        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          In this involve only upper layer of skin the epidermis ( skin
          surface).it usually produce a pink to reddish colour on the burned
          skin and very sensitive to touch and skin appear blanched when light
          pressure is applied. This burns is produce redness pain and minor
          swelling. Healing time is about 3 – 6 days.
        </p>

          It affect both the outer layer ( epidermis ) and under layer lining of
          skin ( dermis ) causing redness, pain , swelling and blisters. There
          symptoms include red, blistered, and may be swollen and painful.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-5xl my-10">
          • Full thickness and third-degree burns:
        </h3>
        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          Third-degree burns destroy the epidermis and dermis. They may go into
          the innermost layer of skin, the subcutaneous tissue. The burn site
          may look white or blackened and charred.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-5xl my-10">• Fourth-degree burns:</h3>

          Fourth-degree burns go through both layers of the skin and underlying
          tissue as well as deeper tissue, possibly involving muscle and bone.
          There is no feeling in the area since the nerve endings are destroyed.
        </p>

          B) According to burn severity:
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-5xl my-10">1) Minor Burns :</h3>
        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          All 1st degree burns as well as second degree burns that involves less
          than 10% of the body surface usually are classified as minor

        <h3 className="text-5xl my-10">2) Moderate burns:</h3>
        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          Burns involving hand s and feet face or genital , second degree burns
          involving more than 10 % body surface area . superficial partial

        <h3 className="text-3xl my-10">✓ The rule of nine :</h3>
        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          This allows the emergency medical provider to obtain a quick estimate
          of how much body surface area is burned. For example, if a patient's
          entire back (18%) and entire left leg (18%) are burned, about 36% of
          the patient's BSA is affected. The BSAs assigned to each body part
          refer to the entire body part. So, for example, if half of a patient's
          left leg were burned, it would be assigned a BSA value of 9% (half the
          total surface area of the leg). Thus, if a patient's entire back
          (18%), but only half of their left leg (9%) was burned, the amount of
          BSA affected would be 27%.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-3xl my-10">✓ Lund and Browder method :</h3>
        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          For children and infants, the Lund-Browder chart is used to assess the
          burned body surface area. Different percentages are used because the
          ratio of the combined surface area of the head and neck to the surface
          area of the limbs is typically larger in children than that of an
          adult.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-3xl my-10">✓ Palm method</h3>
        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          The "rule of palm" is another way to estimate the size of a burn. The
          palm of the person who is burned (not fingers or wrist area) is about
          1% of the body. Use the person's palm to measure the body surface area
          burned. It can be hard to estimate the size of a burn

        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          Burn managements can be organized chronologically into three phases
          emergent (resuscitative) , acute ( wound healing ) , and
          rehabilitative (restorative ) . For example , the emergent phase begin
          at the time of the burn injury, and care often begin in the
          prehospital phase, depending on the skill level of providers at the
          scene . Planning for rehabilitation begins on the day of the burn
          injury or admission to the burn center. Formal rehabilitation begins
          as soon as functional assessment can be performed . wound care is the
          primary focus on acute phase , but wound care also takes place in both
          the emergent and rehabilitation phase.

          • Small thermal burns ( 10 % or less of TBSA ) should be covered with
          a clean , cool, tap water dampened towel for the patients comfort and
          protection until medical care is available.

          ➢ Airway stability should be assessed rapidly in burns involving
          facial or suspected inhalation injuries, particularly in the early
          period following injury when the airway is at risk of obstruction due
          to swelling of the oropharynx and soft tissues of the neck.
          <br />➢ Airway burns, smoke inhalation syndrome, severe burns of face

          <br />
          Wound care consist of ongoing observation , assessment , cleansing ,
          debridement and dressing reapplication. Nonsurgical debridement ,
          dressing changes topical antimicrobial therapy , graft care and donor
          site care are performed as often as necessary , depending on the
          topical cream or dressing ordered.
          <br />
          Enzymatic debriders made of natural ingredient , such as collagen ,
          may ne used for enzymatic debridement of burns wounds, which speeds up
          the removal of dead tissue from the healthy wound bed.
          <br />
          Cleans wound with the soap and water or normal saline moistened gauze
          to the remove the old antimicrobial agent. During the debridement
          phase , cover the wound with topical antimicrobial creams( e.g. silver
          sulfadiazine) or silver impregnated dressing.
          <br />
          Dressings — A variety of antimicrobial agents can be applied to the
          burn wound surface, which is then covered with one of several dressing
          materials (eg, gauze, nonadherent films, honey , bactrigras dressing )

        <p onMouseUp={selecttext} className={Styles.para}>
          • If patient is stable, then early excision is done within 48 hours.
          <br />
          • At a time, 15-20% dead skin is excised, and the wound is covered by
          autograft or allograft, and sometimes sandwich grafting is used.
          <br />
          • If patient's condition is not stable, then delayed debridement is
          done after 15-20 days, after patient becomes stable, followed by skin
          grafting. <br />
          • In the care of unavailability of autograft, for high percentage of
          burns , glycerol preserved allograft from cadaver is used as temporary
          biological dressing material
          <br />
          • Biologic grafts — Biologic graft materials that can be used for
          temporary coverage of burn wounds include allografts, xenografts, and
          others (eg, human amnion).
          <br />
          • Semibiologic skin substitutes are temporary biosynthetic dressings
          that are meant to reduce the number of dressing changes and facilitate
          healing. The semipermeable nature of these dressings allows wound
          exudate to be absorbed by the external bulky dressing.

          The nursing assessment focuses on the major priorities for any trauma
          patient; the burn wound is a secondary consideration.
          <br />
          ✓ Obtain history. Assess body temperature, body weight, history of
          preburn weight, allergies, tetanus immunization, past medical surgical
          problems, current illnesses, and use of medications.
          <br />
          ✓ Arrange for patients with facial burns to be assessed for corneal
          injury.
          <br />
          ✓ Continue to assess the extent of the burn; assess depth of wound,
          and identify areas of full and partial thickness injury.
          <br />
          ✓ Assess neurologic status: consciousness, psychological status, pain
          and anxiety levels, and behaviour.
          <br />
          ✓ Assess patient’s and family’s understanding of injury and treatment.
          Assess patient’s support system and coping skills.
          <br />
          ✓ Focus on the major priorities of any trauma patient. the burn wound
          is a secondary consideration, although aseptic management of the burn
          wounds and invasive lines continues.
          <br />
          ✓ Assess circumstances surrounding the injury. Time of injury,
          mechanism of burn, whether the burn occurred in a closed space, the
          possibility of inhalation of noxious chemicals, and any related
          trauma.
          <br />
          ✓ Monitor vital signs frequently. Monitor respiratory status closely;
          and evaluate apical, carotid, and femoral pulses particularly in areas
          of circumferential burn injury to an extremity.
          <br />
          ✓ Start cardiac monitoring if indicated. If patient has history of
          cardiac or respiratory problems, electrical injury.
          <br />
          ✓ Check peripheral pulses on burned extremities hourly; use Doppler as
          needed.
          <br />✓ Monitor fluid intake (IV fluids) and output (urinary catheter)
          and measure hourly. Note amount of urine obtained when catheter is
